      <p>
        The banking industry faces a significant challenge with customer churn, which directly impacts profitability and growth. This project focuses on a detailed churn analysis of bank customers to uncover critical insights into customer behavior, identify patterns contributing to churn, and recommend strategies for retention. Using a comprehensive dataset, various factors such as demographics, activity status, credit scores, and account balances were analyzed. The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help the bank mitigate churn and improve customer satisfaction.      </p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Problem statement</h2>
      <p>
        Customer churn remains a key obstacle for the banking sector, as retaining existing customers is far more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. High churn rates often result from dissatisfaction, lack of engagement, or competition. For this analysis, the objective is to identify the characteristics of customers most likely to churn and pinpoint actionable trends from the dataset to enable the bank to design targeted strategies. Understanding churn drivers such as age, account balance, and credit scores is vital for predicting future behavior and formulating retention strategies.

    <h2>Data Cleansing & Transformation (SQL)</h2>
    <p> 
        The dataset used for this project required significant preprocessing to ensure accuracy and reliability. Excel was employed to clean and transform the raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis. This included handling missing values, ensuring consistent formatting, and creating calculated columns such as churn rates and age groups. Additionally, redundant entries were removed, and numerical values were standardized to maintain consistency. The cleaned dataset provided the foundation for generating meaningful insights in subsequent stages.

    <h2>Project Analysis</h2>

    <div class="analysis-section">
        <h3>Key Observations</h3>

        <h4>1. Customer Demographics and Activity:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Gender Distribution:</b> The gender distribution is fairly balanced, with male and female customers represented equally. This indicates no significant churn discrepancy based on gender.</li>
            <li><b>Activity Status:</b> A substantial portion of customers are inactive, which could correlate with a higher likelihood of churn.</li>
            <li><b>Credit Card Ownership:</b> Most customers own a credit card, suggesting that the bank has successfully cross-sold credit cards. However, credit card ownership may not directly impact churn without further insights.</li>
            <li><b>Country Distribution:</b> France has the highest number of customers, followed by Germany and Spain. Churn rates could vary by country, potentially due to differences in customer needs or satisfaction.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>2. Churn Analysis by Product:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Product Distribution:</b> Product 1 is the most popular among customers, while Product 3 has the lowest customer base. This could imply that Product 1 is either a more attractive offering or has better customer retention. However, Product 3 might need adjustments or more targeted marketing to improve uptake.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>3. Churn Rate by Age Group:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Age Groups:</b> Customers aged 31-40 form the largest customer base, but those aged 51-60 have the highest churn rate at 56%, followed by ages 41-50 at 30.8%.</li>
            <li><b>Younger Customers:</b> Younger customers (under 30) and those above 71 have minimal churn rates, indicating that the middle-aged demographic is the most at-risk for churn.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>4. Churn Rate by Credit Score:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Largest Customer Group:</b> The 601-700 credit score range holds the largest customer group, with lower churn rates around 19.7%.</li>
            <li><b>Low Credit Scores:</b> Customers with lower credit scores (below 400) experience a high churn rate of 100%, suggesting that poor credit scores may correlate with higher churn. The bank may need to review policies for supporting lower credit score customers to reduce churn.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>5. Churn Rate by Account Balance:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>High Churn:</b> Customers with balances between 10K and 100K have the highest churn rate at 100%, while customers with higher balances (100K-200K) have a churn rate of 25%.</li>
            <li><b>Lower Churn:</b> Higher account balances are associated with lower churn rates, suggesting that wealthier customers are more likely to stay with the bank.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <div class="recommendations">
            <h2>Future Recommendations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Improve Engagement with Inactive Customers:</b> Design a reactivation campaign for inactive customers, offering incentives like interest rate benefits or fee waivers for meeting activity thresholds.</li>
                <li><b>Target High-Risk Age Groups:</b> Implement personalized retention programs for customers aged 51-60 and 41-50, focusing on loyalty programs and tailored financial services.</li>
                <li><b>Refine Product Offerings:</b> Relaunch or improve Product 3 and promote add-on services with Product 1 to boost retention.</li>
                <li><b>Support Low Credit Score Customers:</b> Introduce financial counseling or credit improvement programs for customers with credit scores below 400 to reduce churn.</li>
                <li><b>Focus on High-Balance Customers:</b> Offer exclusive benefits to customers with balances between 100K-200K, such as personalized wealth management services.</li>
                <li><b>Regional Strategy Optimization:</b> Develop specific retention strategies for France and gather insights from Germany and Spain to address regional churn drivers.</li>
                <li><b>Optimize Customer Segmentation:</b> Use data to segment customers by risk level and tailor communications for high-risk groups.</li>
                <li><b>Monitor Churn Indicators:</b> Regularly review churn metrics to adapt strategies in real-time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By addressing these recommendations, the bank can proactively mitigate churn and enhance customer retention.</p>
